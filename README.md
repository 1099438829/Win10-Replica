Windows 10 HTML Replica
Designed by Microsoft (obviously)
Replicated by Tanner Villarete

This replica is very much a work in progress. Currently many core features are missing, however, the following are working:

  1. Desktop (non-mobile devices)
    - Click and drag support for window management
    - Resize windows using click-to-drag
    - Rearrange desktop and taskbar icons
    - Click to bring window to top
    
     Desktop (universal)
    - Minimize, maximize, close windows
 
  2. Start Menu
    - (non-mobile) Rearrange start menu apps
    - Launch any app that has an icon
    - 'Restart' Windows or enter settings
    
  3. Cortana
    - Pretty much useless, but the animation is there :)
    
  Built-in 'Apps'
  1. Edge browser 
    - Navigate to any website that supports iframes
    
  2. Settings
    - Personalize the background of your desktop using either your own background URL
      or one of the preset backgrounds
    - Change the color of your Start Menu Apps
    - Read more about me
    
  3. Spotify
    - Play tunes from one of my playlists (It's an embed of spotify)
    
  4. Terminal
    - Do computery stuff to make you look cooler I guess
    
  5. File Explorer
    - Absolutely useless, but what is windows without Explorer?
    
  *I'll add things to this project as I think of things for it. Feel free to give me some ideas!*
